## Introduction
Microcontrollers (MCUs) are very cheap electronic components, usually with just a few kilobytes of RAM and designed to consume small amounts of power. Today, MCUs can be found embedded in all residential, medical, automotive, and industrial devices. It is estimated that more than 40 billion microcontrollers are marketed annually, and hundreds of billions are currently in service. But, curiously, these devices do not receive much attention because, many times, they are used just to replace functionalities that older electromechanical systems face in cars, washing machines, or remote controls.

More recently, with the era of IoT (Internet of Things), a significant part of these MCUs is generating "quintillions" of data, which in their majority, are not used due to the high cost and complexity of their data transmission (bandwidth and latency).
 
On the other hand, in the last decades, we have witnessed the development of Machine Learning models (sub-area of Artificial Intelligence) trained with "tons" of data and powerful mainframes. But what is happening now is that, suddenly, it becomes possible for "noisy" and complex signals, such as images, audio, or accelerometers, to extract meaning from the same through neural networks. And what is more important is that we can execute these models of neural networks in microcontrollers and sensors using very little energy and extract much more meaning from the data generated by these sensors, which we are currently ignoring.

    This is TinyML, a new area of Applyed AI, that allows extracting "machine intelligence" from the physical world (where the data is generated).

## Overview of the Applied AI Track
The Applied AI Track is an introductory course on the intersection between Machine Learning and Embedded Devices. The spread of embedded devices with ultra-low power consumption (on the order of milliwatts), together with the introduction of machine learning frameworks dedicated to embedded devices, such as TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TF Lite Micro), allow the mass proliferation of IoT devices empowered by AI (“AioT”).

This course will be divided into two main parts: Fundamentals and Applications.
